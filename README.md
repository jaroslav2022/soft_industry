reusable test components such as Page Objects or Tasks here.

###What was refactored and why
* __line 29:__
```java
response.body("title", contains("mango")));
```
changed to
```java
response.body("title", hasItem("AH Mango")));
```
Because `actual` is `java.lang.Iterable` and needs corresponding `Matcher`

* __line 34:__
```java
response.body("error", contains("True")));
```
changed to
```java
response.body("detail.error", equalTo(true)));
```
Because path is incomplete and `actual` should have corresponding `Matcher`
